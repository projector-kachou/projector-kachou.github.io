# The Projector

## What is "The Projector"? 

Originally the name was "'Project' Is A Verb", but the pronunciation is unclear. So we went with "The Projector". 

The point is to avoid *nominalizations*. A "project" is a *thing*, but it's not. It's always a living *process*. So use the verb, to "project". What are you projecting?
