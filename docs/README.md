# The Projector

## What is "The Projector"? 

Originally the name was "'Project' Is A Verb", but the pronunciation is unclear. So we went with "The Projector". 

The point is to avoid *nominalizations*. A "project" is a *thing*, but it's not. It's always a living *process*. So we use the verb, "to project". 

The question then becomes: What are you projecting? What do you want to project?


The initial goal is to bootstrap a team communication application. Once that works, we build something bigger. 

# Explanation

- Phase 1: Build a communications program that works well enough to build itself with. 
- Phase 2: Build the actual thing.

The *actual thing* is pretty straightforward. 

You know, of course, that every website, search engine, and mobile app are designed using psychological techniques to hack your brain into spending time and effort looking at them (typically so you see ads). 

So the hell with that. Instead, we propose to *hack our own brains* into spending time and effort doing the things we actually want to do. Like writing code, or learning a new language, or cooking healthily and working out using a productive training program.

Techniques that will be used include:
- NLP (Natural Language Processing) -- large language model AIs
- NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) -- a subset of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, used to instill and reinforce desired habits
- Periodic Reinforcement -- a learning method used by Anki, Duolingo, and many other sources to optimize memory retention and recall
- Gamification -- login bonuses, streaks, all the nasty addictive tricks mobile games use, but with full disclosure as to what we're doing.
- Encabulation -- AI models, when used, will be strictly kept away from our user data. Only well-behaved LLMs which respect user privacy are allowed.

## What Could I Do With This Program?
- Learn a language (like Python)
- Learn a language (like Spanish)
- Meal prep, shopping, and cooking to meet a goal (low-carb, etc.)
- Create and track an exercise/training program
- Run a book club
- Teach a class
- Organize and track a project

Most likely various plugins will be developed for these specific uses -- or maybe people will fork the project and do it that way.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Why not just use Discord or the like?
- Discord is infested with degenerates.
- Existing "team communication" software doesn't respect your privacy or your freedoms.
- We need to eat our own dogfood -- if you use your own programs, you will be motivated to make them suck less.

## I need a blurb to put on my resume or something.

OK.

`Projector aims to build an intentional community for programming training and project oversight. It will be used to build web applications serving specific communities and their needs. The Projector team prioritizes respect for users' privacy and freedoms.`

## But, seriously, what is it actually supposed to do.

An *intentional community* is just a team of people who have a common goal (intent). A common type of intentional community is a "learning community" such as a study group. A software team is also an intentional community.

Social networks pretend to build intentional communities, but they don't. They prioritize selling ads and user data, with serving the users as a distant third.

Schools and colleges would like to be thought of as learning communities. Their priority, like all institutions, are perpetuation of the institution itself. If this involves teaching students, then they teach students. If this involves some other, more direct method, then they use that.

*(for instance, if they were paid to close down for 2 years, and pretend to 'teach remotely', or something equally implausible. The point is, don't trust institutions.)*

TLDR: the idea is to use Projector to put a group of people together, and have the software reinforce regular collaboration and helping each other.

How it will do that I'll get to in a later post.
