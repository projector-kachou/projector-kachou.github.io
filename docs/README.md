# The Projector

## What is "The Projector"? 

Originally the name was "'Project' Is A Verb", but the pronunciation is unclear. So we went with "The Projector". 

The point is to avoid *nominalizations*. A "project" is a *thing*, but it's not. It's always a living *process*. So we use the verb, "to project". 

The question then becomes: What are you projecting? What do you want to project?

## No, really, what the f#ck is this project?

The initial goal is to bootstrap a team communication application. Once that works, we build something bigger. 

## Why not just use Discord or the like?
- Discord is for degenerates.
- Existing "team communication" software doesn't respect your privacy or your freedoms.
- We need to eat our own dogfood -- if you use your own programs, you will be motivated to make them suck less.

## I need a blurb to put on my resume or something.

OK.
`Projector aims to build an intentional community for programming training and project oversight. It will be used to build web applications serving specific communities and their needs. The Projector team prioritizes respect for users' privacy and freedoms.`

## But, seriously, what is it actually supposed to do.

An *intentional community* is just a team of people who have a common goal (intent). A common type of intentional community is a "learning community" such as a study group. A software team is also an intentional community.

Social networks pretend to build intentional communities, but they don't. They prioritize selling ads and user data, with serving the users as a distant third.

Schools and colleges would like to be thought of as learning communities. Their priority, like all institutions, are perpetuation of the institution itself. If this involves teaching students, then they teach students. If this involves some other, more direct method*, then they use that.

*(*for instance, nypothetically, if they were paid to close down for 2 years, and pretend to 'teach remotely', to sell the idea of a deadly cold, or something equally ridiculous.)

So the idea is to use Projector to put a group of people together, and have the software reinforce regular collaboration and helping each other.

How it will do that I'll get to in a later post.
